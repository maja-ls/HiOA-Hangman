        \n\n\nThe app will select a word randomly.
        \n The goal is to guess what the word is.
        \n\n You can tell how many letters are in the word by the number of underlines shown.
        \n\n If you guess a letter correctly, the corresponding underline(s) will be replaced by that letter.
        \n\n Every time you guess a letter which is not in the word, you are one step closer to being hung.
        \n\n\n Do not get hung.
